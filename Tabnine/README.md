### **Privacy**

Concerned about privacy and security? So are we!

​
Your code’s privacy is our highest priority. Tabnine keeps your code completely private
​

Tabnine offers code completion suggestions based on a model trained on millions of open-source code lines, which are then derived from the code you are currently working on. Tabnine only sends minimal contextual information from your currently edited file that allows us to make predictions based on your current local scope
​

We do not use your code to train our models and the information sent to our servers is only used to compute your prediction and is not being saved on our end

### auto_complete: false
___
The Tabnine sublime plugin disables sublime's [built in autocomplete](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/auto_complete.html).  
It does that, because sublime's builtin autocomplete does not support all the features required by Tabnine.  
If you ever uninstall Tabnine, remember to re-enable it.

### **Development:**
___
In order to work with plugin source code, don’t forget to install [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) dependency. After checking out source code, go to repo folder and run

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
